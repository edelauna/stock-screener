1. Search for a stock ticker in the search bar.

2. The resulting page should display a summary line and two graphs.

### Summary Line
The summary line will contain a signal indicating whether to **Buy**, **Sell**, or **Hold**, along with the most recent price and date.

### Graphs
There are two interconnected graphs. For the best experience, use a landscape orientation or a larger screen. 

- The top graph shows a snapshot of the historical signals.
- The lower graph features a brush window functionality where you can drag the window to different time periods or extend/shrink the window.

Example functionality of the graphs:
